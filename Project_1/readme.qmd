## Narrative

I am investigating whether an AI detection model is more likely to flag a certain style of writing. Through this project, my goal is to predict whether a human-written sample and an AI-generated sample is likely to be flagged based on the writing conventions present. I chose this dataset because of the rampant use of AI and AI detection models (TurnItIn, Grammarly) that tend to output false positives. The raw data comes from Simon Couch's detectors R package and the processed data present in Project 1 comes from TidyTuesday - GPT Detectors (07/18/2023).

## Data

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-07-18')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 29)

detectors <- tuesdata$detectors

detectors <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-07-18/detectors.csv')
```

```{r}
library(tibble)
glimpse(data)
```
